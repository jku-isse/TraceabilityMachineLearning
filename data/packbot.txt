PackBot

PackBot is a series of military robots by iRobot. More than 2000 were used in Iraq and Afghanistan.[1] PackBots were the first robots to enter the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.[2] As of November 2014, the U.S. Army is refurbishing 224 iRobot 510 robots.[3]

Current PackBot 510 variants

PackBot 510 is the current base model. It uses a videogame-style hand controller to make it more familiar to young operators. Configurations include:

PackBot 510 with EOD Bomb Disposal Kit designed for improvised explosive device identification and disposal.
PackBot 510 with Fast Tactical Maneuvering Kit designed for infantry troops tasked with improvised explosive device inspection. This is a lighter weight robot.
PackBot 510 with First Responder Kit designed to help SWAT teams and other first responders with situational awareness.
PackBot 510 with HazMat Detection Kit collects air samples to detect chemical and radiological agents.
PackBot 510 with Fido utilizes the Fido Explosives Detector from ICx Technologies as a payload in order to "sniff" out explosive materials. With the Fido, the PackBot now has the capability of locating explosive devices and subsequently disarming them using on-board robotic capabilities.[4]
PackBot 510 with REDOWL Sniper Detection Kit utilizes the Acoustic Direction Finder from BioMimetic Systems to localize gunshots with azimuth, elevation, and range.[5]
RC2 - U.S. Marine Corps version of the 510 PackBot with a longer and stronger arm, more cameras, communications variations, and better track propulsion.[6]

Previous PackBot variants

PackBot Scout is the basic configuration. It has five payload bays for assignable purposes and can be dropped from a height of six feet (1.83m) onto concrete without being damaged. The Packbot scout version weighs about 40 pounds (18 kg).
PackBot Explorer has a camera head equipped with multiple cameras, laser pointers, audio and other sensors.
PackBot EOD (explosive-ordnance disposal) can be controlled by radio or wired control to handle situations involving potential explosives, thereby reducing the risk of personal injury.
