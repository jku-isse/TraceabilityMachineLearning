 * When the <code>nextToken</code> method encounters a string
 * constant, the <code>ttype</code> field is set to the string
 * delimiter and the <code>sval</code> field is set to the body of
 * the string.

 * If a string quote character is encountered, then a string is
 * recognized, consisting of all characters after (but not including)
 * the string quote character, up to (but not including) the next
 * occurrence of that same string quote character, or a line
 * terminator, or end of file. The usual escape sequences such as
 * <code>"&#92;n"</code> and <code>"&#92;t"</code> are recognized and
 * converted to single characters as the string is parsed.
