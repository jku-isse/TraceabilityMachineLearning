/**
 * Reads a &lt;draw:frame&gt; element from the specified
 * XML element.
 * <p>
 * A frame is a rectangular container where that contains enhanced content
 * like text boxes, images or objects. Frames are very similar to regular
 * drawing shapes, but support some features that are not available for
 * regular drawing shapes, like contours, image maps and hyperlinks. In
 * particular, a frame allows to have multiple renditions of an object. That
 * is, a frame may for instance contain an object as well as an image. In
 * this case, the application may choose the content that it supports best.
 * If the application supports the object type contained in the frame, it
 * probably will render the object. If it does not support the object, it
 * will render the image.
 * <p>
 * In general, an application must not render more than one of the content
 * elements contained in a frame. The order of content elements dictates
 * the document authors preference for rendering, with the first child
 * being the most preferred. This means that applications should render the
 * first child element that it supports. A frame must contain at least one
 * content element. The inclusion of multiple content elements is optional.
 * Application may preserve the content elements they dont render, but
 * dont have to.
 * <p>
 * Within text documents, frames are also used to position content outside
 * the default text flow of a document.
 * <p>
 * Frames can contain:
 * • Text boxes
 * • Objects represented either in the OpenDocument format or in a object
 *      specific binary format
 * • Images
 * • Applets
 * • Plug-ins
 * • Floating frames
 * <p>
 * Like the formatting properties of drawing shapes, frame formatting
 * properties are stored in styles belonging to the graphic family. The way
 * a frame is contained in a document also is the same as for drawing shapes.
 *
 * @param elem
 * 		A &lt;frame&gt; element.
