// BOUNDS
/**
 * Sets the logical and untransformed bounds of the figure.
 * <p>
 * This is used by Tools which create a new Figure and by Tools which
 * connect a Figure to another Figure.
 * <p>
 * This is a basic operation which does not fire events. Use the following
 * code sequence, if you need event firing:
 * <pre>
 * aFigure.willChange();
 * aFigure.setBounds(...);
 * aFigure.changed();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param start
 * 		the start point of the bounds
 * @param end
 * 		the end point of the bounds
 * @see #getBounds
