/**
 * Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during
 * <code>installUI</code>.  This method is invoked when this
 * <code>UIComponent</code> instance is being removed as the UI delegate
 * for the specified component.  This method should undo the
 * configuration performed in <code>installUI</code>, being careful to
 * leave the <code>JComponent</code> instance in a clean state (no
 * extraneous listeners, look-and-feel-specific property objects, etc.).
 * This should include the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Remove any UI-set borders from the component.
 * <li>Remove any UI-set layout managers on the component.
 * <li>Remove any UI-added sub-components from the component.
 * <li>Remove any UI-added event/property listeners from the component.
 * <li>Remove any UI-installed keyboard UI from the component.
 * <li>Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC.
 * </ol>
 *
 * @param c
 * 		the component from which this UI delegate is being removed;
 * 		this argument is often ignored,
 * 		but might be used if the UI object is stateless
 * 		and shared by multiple components
 * @see #installUI
 * @see javax.swing.JComponent#updateUI
