/**
 * Transforms the shape of the Figure. Transformations using double
 * precision arithmethics are inherently lossy operations. Therefore it is
 * recommended to use getTransformRestoreData() restoreTransformTo() to
 * provide lossless undo/redo functionality.
 * <p>
 * This is a basic operation which does not fire events. Use the following
 * code sequence, if you need event firing:
 * <pre>
 * aFigure.willChange();
 * aFigure.transform(...);
 * aFigure.changed();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param tx
 * 		The transformation.
 * @see #getTransformRestoreData
