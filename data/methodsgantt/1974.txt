/**
 * Returns the entire image in a single Raster.  For images with
 * multiple tiles this will require making a copy.
 *
 * <p> The returned Raster is semantically a copy.  This means
 * that updates to the source image will not be reflected in the
 * returned Raster.  For non-writable (immutable) source images,
 * the returned value may be a reference to the images internal
 * data.  The returned Raster should be considered non-writable;
 * any attempt to alter its pixel data (such as by casting it to
 * WritableRaster or obtaining and modifying its DataBuffer) may
 * result in undefined behavior.  The copyData method should be
 * used if the returned Raster is to be modified.
 *
 * @return a Raster containing a copy of this images data.
