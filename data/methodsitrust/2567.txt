// The following test uses an advanced concept not taught in CSC326 at NCSU called Mock Objects.
// Feel free to take a look at how this works, but know that you will not need to know mock objects
// to do nearly everything in iTrust. Unless your assignment mentions mock objects somewhere, you should
// not need them.
// 
// But, if you are interested in a cool unit testing concept, feel free to look at this code as an
// example.
// 
// This class uses the EasyMock library to manage the mock objects. http://easymock.org/
