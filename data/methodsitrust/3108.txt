 * This method is implemented using {@link FamilyDAO} for 2 reasons: (a) definitions of family members
 * might change, so its better to centralize that code and (2) to make this code a little bit "nicer"
 * even though it executes one query per family member. If this method gets slow, then you will need to
 * refactor. Otherwise, lets just keep it simple...

 * @param icdUpper

 * @return A boolean indicating whether a family member had a match in this range.
